# Penalized PLS

<!-- badges: start -->

<!-- badges: end -->

## Introduction

This R package implements a flexible and powerful framework for **penalized Partial Least Squares (PPLS)**, including:

- B-spline basis transformations of the input data,
- Construction of difference penalty matrices,
- Cross-validation for hyperparameter tuning (`lambda`, `ncomp`),
- Visualization of component effects,
- Jackknife-based inference (covariance, t-tests),
- Support for block-wise variable selection and kernel PPLS.

It is particularly suited for **high-dimensional, structured, and nonlinear regression problems**, such as functional data or spectral data.

## Installation

We recommend to install the CRAN version for a stable version of `ppls`.

```r
install.packages("ppls")
```

Alternatively, install the development version from GitHub with:

```r
# install.packages("pak") ## If necessary, install "pak" beforehand
pak::pak("vguillemot/ppls")
```

---

## Example: Fit a Penalized PLS Model with Splines

The following is an example of how use `ppls` on the `cookie` dataset included in the package:

```r
library(ppls)

# Load data
data(cookie)
X <- as.matrix(cookie$NIR)  # NIR spectra
y <- as.vector(cookie$constituents$fat)    # Fat content

# Run cross-validation with splines
result <- ppls.splines.cv(
  X, y,
  lambda = c(10, 100, 500),
  ncomp = 5,
  degree = 3,
  order = 2,
  nknot = 20
)

# Extract optimal lambda and number of components
result$lambda.opt
result$ncomp.opt
```

---

## Visualizing Components

```r
# Plot fitted additive components
graphic.ppls.splines(
  X, y,
  lambda = result$lambda.opt,
  ncomp = result$ncomp.opt,
  add.data = TRUE,
  select = TRUE,
  window.size = c(3, 4)
)
```

---

## Inference with Jackknife

```r
# Jackknife estimation and t-tests
jack <- jack.ppls(result)
coef(jack)
vcov(jack)

t.stats <- ttest.ppls(result)
t.stats$pvalues
```

---

## Simulated Data

The function `sim.data.ppls()` allows generating synthetic nonlinear data for benchmarking:

```r
sim <- sim.data.ppls(ntrain = 100, ntest = 100, stnr = 3, p = 20)
str(sim)
```

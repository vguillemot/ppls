\title{Penalty matrix for higher order differences}
\description{
  This function computes the matrix that penalizes the higher order differences.
}
\usage{
Penalty.matrix(m,order = 2)
}
%- maybe also 'usage' for other objects documented here.
\arguments{
  \item{m}{vector. The \eqn{j}th entry determines the size of the
    \eqn{j}th block in the penalty term.}
  \item{order}{order of the differences. Default value is \code{order}=2.}
}
\details{For the jth entry of the vector \code{m}, and for the default values \code{order}=2, the penalty matrix \eqn{P_j}  penalizes the second order
  differences of a vector \eqn{v} of length m[j]. That is
  \deqn{v^T P_j v=  \sum_{i=3} ^{m[j]} (\Delta v_i) ^2}
  where
  \deqn{\Delta v_i= v_i -2 v_{i-1} + v_{i-2}}
  is the second order difference. This definition is easily extended to
  other values of \code{order}. The final penalty matrix \code{P} is a
  block-diagonal matrix with the jth block equal to \eqn{P_j}.  More
  details can be found in Kraemer, Boulesteix, and Tutz (2008).
